EE361 - Electromechanical Energy Conversion
=====
### Scope of EE361 and EE362 Courses:
We will cover methods for Electromechanical Energy Conversion(EMEC), which can be in two ways:
* Mechanical Energy to Electrical Energy (i.e. **Generators**)
* Electrical Energy to Mechanical Energy (i.e. **Motors**)

Although, it is not a EMEC device, we will also cover **transformers**, which is a critical component in transmission of energy.

#### Why the Hassle?
Why do we need transformers? Why don't we transmit electric with the same voltage that comes out og the generator?

[Thomas Edison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison) thought the same way and he setup a DC transmission system. However, he soon realized he has to install power stations every few hundred meters around the city, because **low voltage electric transmission is expensive and inefficient**. Thus, the cities filled-up with over head lines.

Then, [Nikola Tesla](http://www.gothamcenter.org/blotter/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Tesla-2.jpg), suggested use of alternating current (AC) tranmission lines, which triggered the [War of Currents](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Currents). (Reading suggestion: [AC vs. DC](http://blog.batteryquality.com/ac-vs-dc-alternating-current-vs-direct-current/)). After many years of competition between rival companies (Edison even [electrocuted an elephant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD0Q5FeF_wU)(may be disturbing) to prove how dangerous AC can be), DC transmission system lost the competition and AC became the world's standard for power generation and distribution.
