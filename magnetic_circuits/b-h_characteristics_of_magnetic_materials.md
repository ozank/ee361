# B-H Characteristics

## Linear - Non-linear Materials

$$\vec{B} = \mu \vec{H}$$

**Linear magnetic materials**: The slope of the B-H curve is constant and equal to $$\mu$$.

**Non-linear magnetic materials**: Ferromagnetic materials have a higher permeability than air. However, the permeability is not constant, and reduces as the magnetic field strength is increased. Ferromagnetic materials have a maximum flux density limit, $$B_{saturation}$$. It is usually around 1.6-2.0 T.
