# Transformers
Transformer is a device that involves magnetically coupled coils. ALthough, there are some air-cored transformers, most of the transformers consists of a highly permeable core that magnetically connects two coils. Highly permeable core has two advantages

- Almost all flux links the secondary coil (minimal leakage flux)
- The reluctance of the magnetic path is low (requires less magnetising current).

Transformers only works with alternating current (see introduction section).
Transformer's  primary and secondary coils are electrically isolated, but there's a power flow, which is transferred via the magnetic flux.
