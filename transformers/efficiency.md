# Efficiency
$$\mathrm{Efficiency (\eta) = \frac{Pout}{Pin}}$$

$$\mathrm{Efficiency (\eta) = \frac{Pout}{Pout+\mathrm{Losses}}}$$


Ther are two types of losses in a transformer:
- **Constant Losses:** Core Losses (Eddy, Hysteresis)
$$\frac{V_1^2}{Rcore}$$

- **Variable Losses:** Copper Losses

$$I_1^2 (R_1 + R_2')$$

A transformer has maximum efficiency when:

Copper Losses = Core Losses

#### Example:
For the same transformer used in the previous problems, calculate the efficiency at rated current and 0.8 pf lagging.
